# Manual Testing Guide — Reflexio × OpenClaw Integration

Step-by-step guide for manually testing the integration end-to-end. Each phase builds on the previous one. This guide is self-contained — you should not need to reference other documentation.

## Prerequisites

- OpenClaw installed and running: `openclaw --version`
- Reflexio CLI installed: `pip install reflexio` (or `uv pip install reflexio`)
- An LLM API key for the Reflexio server (e.g., `export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...`)
- A terminal where you can see OpenClaw's stderr output (agent logs)

### How to view agent logs

OpenClaw outputs hook logs to stderr. To see Reflexio hook messages during a session:

```bash
# Option A: Run openclaw in a terminal and watch stderr
openclaw chat 2>reflexio-hook.log
# In another terminal: tail -f reflexio-hook.log

# Option B: Run with stderr visible
openclaw chat 2>&1 | tee session.log
```

Look for lines starting with `[reflexio]` — these are from the Reflexio hooks.

---

## Phase 1: Install & Verify

### 1.1 Run the setup wizard

```bash
reflexio setup openclaw
```

Follow the prompts to select your LLM provider and storage backend (SQLite for local testing).

### 1.2 Verify all components are installed

```bash
# Hook registered?
openclaw hooks list
# Expected: ✓ ready │ 🧠 reflexio-context

# Skill installed?
ls ~/.openclaw/skills/reflexio/SKILL.md

# Rule installed?
ls ~/.openclaw/workspace/reflexio.md

# Commands installed?
ls ~/.openclaw/skills/reflexio-extract/SKILL.md
ls ~/.openclaw/skills/reflexio-aggregate/SKILL.md
```

All five checks should succeed. If any fail, re-run `reflexio setup openclaw`.

### 1.3 Verify Reflexio server

```bash
reflexio status check
```

If using a local server and it's not running:

```bash
reflexio services start --only backend &
sleep 5
reflexio status check
# Expected: Server is running
```

---

## Phase 2: Search (Cold Start)

On a fresh install, there are no playbooks yet. This phase verifies the search hook doesn't break agent behavior.

### 2.1 Start a conversation with your default OpenClaw agent

```bash
openclaw chat
```

Send a simple, self-contained task that doesn't require a project:

```
Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers and returns the mean and median.
```

**What to check:**
- The agent responds normally with working code (no errors, no mention of Reflexio)
- In the hook logs (stderr), you should see one of:
  - `[reflexio] Search failed: ...` (if server isn't ready yet — acceptable)
  - Empty search results (expected on cold start)
- The response should NOT be delayed more than ~5 seconds by the hook (timeout limit)

### 2.2 Verify the agent doesn't mention Reflexio

The rule file says "never mention Reflexio to the user." Confirm the agent response contains no references to Reflexio, playbooks, or search results.

---

## Phase 3: Capture & Publish

This phase creates a correction scenario and verifies the system captures it.

### 3.1 Create a correction scenario

In the same session (or a new one via `openclaw chat`), send these messages in order. The goal is to get the agent to do something one way, then correct it:

**Message 1** — give a task with an implicit choice:
```
Write a shell script that installs project dependencies and starts the dev server.
```

Wait for the agent to respond. It will likely use `npm install` or a similar default.

**Message 2** — correct the agent's choice:
```
No, don't use npm. In this project we always use pnpm. Please rewrite using pnpm instead.
```

Wait for the agent to apply the correction.

**Message 3** — continue the task to provide more context:
```
Also add a health check that curls localhost:3000/health before starting the main process.
```

**What to check:**
- The agent applies the correction (uses pnpm in the rewrite)
- In hook logs: look for `reflexio publish` — the skill should detect the correction and publish it
- If you don't see a publish, that's also OK — the session-end hook will capture the full conversation

### 3.2 End the session

Exit the session:
```
/stop
```
(or press Ctrl+C, depending on your OpenClaw configuration)

**What to check in hook logs:**
- `[reflexio] Queued N interactions for publish` — the `command:stop` handler flushed buffered turns

### 3.3 Verify playbooks were extracted

Wait ~30 seconds for server-side LLM extraction, then check:

```bash
reflexio user-playbooks list --limit 10
```

**Expected:** At least one playbook containing "pnpm" (e.g., content like "use pnpm instead of npm").

If no playbooks appear, the batch interval may not have been met (requires 5+ interactions). Use the manual extraction command instead:

```bash
# If no playbooks were extracted automatically, this is expected for short sessions.
# Phase 5 covers manual extraction as a workaround.
```

Also check profiles:
```bash
reflexio user-profiles list --limit 10
```

You may see a profile entry about project conventions (e.g., "uses pnpm").

---

## Phase 4: Retrieval (Warm Start)

This phase verifies the agent applies corrections from previous sessions.

### 4.1 Start a new session and trigger a related task

```bash
openclaw chat
```

Send a task related to the correction from Phase 3:

```
Add the 'lodash' package to this project's dependencies.
```

**What to check:**
- In hook logs: `[reflexio]` lines showing search was executed
- The agent should use `pnpm add lodash` (not `npm install lodash`) — applying the correction from Phase 3 **without being told again**
- If the agent still uses npm, the playbook may not have been extracted yet. Check `reflexio user-playbooks list` and retry after extraction completes.

### 4.2 Send an unrelated task

In the same session:

```
Explain how Python's garbage collector works.
```

**What to check:**
- The search returns different (or no) playbooks — the pnpm correction should NOT appear for a Python question
- The agent responds normally

---

## Phase 5: Manual Commands

### 5.1 Test `/reflexio-extract`

Start a new session and have a conversation with at least one correction or learning:

```bash
openclaw chat
```

Send a few messages:
```
Write a function to validate email addresses using regex.
```
Then after the response:
```
That regex is too permissive. Use a stricter pattern that requires a TLD of at least 2 characters.
```

Now run the extract command:
```
/reflexio-extract
```

**What to check:**
- The agent reviews the conversation and builds a JSON summary
- It publishes via `reflexio publish --force-extraction`
- It reports what was published (e.g., "Published 2 interactions to Reflexio")
- Verify extraction worked:
  ```bash
  reflexio user-playbooks list --limit 10
  ```
  You should see a new playbook about email validation regex.

### 5.2 Test `/reflexio-aggregate`

After accumulating playbooks from Phases 3-5.1:

```
/reflexio-aggregate
```

**What to check:**
- The agent runs `reflexio agent-playbooks aggregate --wait`
- It reports how many agent playbooks were created or updated
- Verify:
  ```bash
  reflexio agent-playbooks list --agent-version openclaw-agent
  ```
  You should see agent playbooks with `PENDING` status.

---

## Phase 6: Multi-User (Multiple Agent Instances)

This phase tests that different OpenClaw agents get isolated user playbooks but share agent playbooks.

### 6.1 Set up a second agent instance

If you don't already have multiple agents, create one. OpenClaw stores agent definitions in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`. Add a second agent:

```bash
openclaw agents add --name test-reviewer
```

This creates a new agent with its own workspace at `~/.openclaw/workspace-test-reviewer/`.

Verify both agents exist:
```bash
openclaw agents list
# Should show at least two agents (e.g., "main" and "test-reviewer")
```

> **Note:** Use whatever agent names you already have. The test just needs two distinct agents. Replace `main` and `test-reviewer` in the commands below with your actual agent names.

### 6.2 Create different corrections on each agent

**Agent 1** (your default agent):
```bash
openclaw chat
```

Have this conversation:
```
Write a function to format a date as a string.
```
Then:
```
Always use ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD) for dates, never locale-specific formats.
```
Exit: `/stop`

**Agent 2** (your second agent):
```bash
openclaw chat --agent test-reviewer
```

Have this conversation:
```
Write a function to log errors.
```
Then:
```
Always include the stack trace when logging errors, not just the message.
```
Exit: `/stop`

### 6.3 Verify user playbook isolation

Wait ~30 seconds for extraction, then check. Replace `main` and `test-reviewer` with your actual agent names:

```bash
# Check what each agent sees (use your actual agent names)
reflexio user-playbooks list --user-id main
reflexio user-playbooks list --user-id test-reviewer
```

**Expected:**
- Agent 1's playbooks include the date formatting correction, NOT the error logging one
- Agent 2's playbooks include the error logging correction, NOT the date formatting one

> **Note:** If playbooks weren't extracted (batch interval not met), manually extract from each agent's session using `/reflexio-extract`, or seed playbooks directly:
> ```bash
> reflexio user-playbooks add --user-id main --content "Always use ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD) for date formatting" --trigger "formatting dates"
> reflexio user-playbooks add --user-id test-reviewer --content "Always include stack traces when logging errors" --trigger "logging errors"
> ```

### 6.4 Aggregate and verify shared playbooks

```bash
reflexio agent-playbooks aggregate --agent-version openclaw-agent --wait
reflexio agent-playbooks list --agent-version openclaw-agent
```

**Expected:**
- Agent playbooks contain corrections from **both** agents (date formatting + error logging)
- Search from either agent returns the shared playbooks:
  ```bash
  reflexio search "format a date" --user-id main
  reflexio search "format a date" --user-id test-reviewer
  ```
  Both should return the date formatting agent playbook.

### 6.5 Clean up test agent (optional)

If you created a test agent just for this phase:
```bash
openclaw agents remove --name test-reviewer
```

---

## Phase 7: Graceful Degradation

### 7.1 Stop the server and verify agent still works

```bash
reflexio services stop
```

Start a new OpenClaw session:
```bash
openclaw chat
```

Send a task:
```
Explain the difference between TCP and UDP.
```

**What to check:**
- The agent responds normally (no crashes, no errors visible to the user)
- In hook logs: `[reflexio] Search failed: connect ECONNREFUSED` (or similar connection error)
- The hook buffers the turn to local SQLite (`~/.reflexio/sessions.db`) — it will be published when the server returns

### 7.2 Restart server and verify buffered turns are retried

```bash
reflexio services start --only backend &
sleep 5
```

Start a new session (this triggers the `agent:bootstrap` event):
```bash
openclaw chat
```

**What to check in hook logs:**
- `[reflexio] Retrying N unpublished session(s)` — the bootstrap handler retries buffered turns from Phase 7.1

Exit the session: `/stop`

---

## Phase 8: Uninstall

### 8.1 Uninstall the integration

```bash
reflexio setup openclaw --uninstall
```

Confirm when prompted.

### 8.2 Verify all components are removed

```bash
openclaw hooks list
# Should NOT show reflexio-context

ls ~/.openclaw/skills/reflexio 2>/dev/null && echo "STILL EXISTS" || echo "Removed"
ls ~/.openclaw/skills/reflexio-extract 2>/dev/null && echo "STILL EXISTS" || echo "Removed"
ls ~/.openclaw/skills/reflexio-aggregate 2>/dev/null && echo "STILL EXISTS" || echo "Removed"
ls ~/.openclaw/workspace/reflexio.md 2>/dev/null && echo "STILL EXISTS" || echo "Removed"
```

All four should print "Removed."

### 8.3 Verify agent works without Reflexio

```bash
openclaw chat
```

Send any message and confirm the agent works normally with no Reflexio-related errors in logs.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Agent doesn't follow past corrections | Search hook timeout or no playbooks yet | Check `reflexio user-playbooks list`; verify server is running |
| `[reflexio] Search failed` in every message | Server not running | `reflexio services start --only backend &` |
| Playbooks not extracted after session | Batch interval not met (need 5+ interactions) | Use `/reflexio-extract` for manual extraction, or seed manually with `reflexio user-playbooks add` |
| Agent mentions Reflexio to user | Rule not installed | Check `ls ~/.openclaw/workspace/reflexio.md`; re-run `reflexio setup openclaw` |
| Wrong user_id in playbooks | `REFLEXIO_USER_ID` env override | Run `unset REFLEXIO_USER_ID`; let auto-detection use the agentId |
| Aggregation never runs | Flag file stuck | `rm ~/.reflexio/logs/.aggregation-running` |
| Can't start second agent | Agent not configured | `openclaw agents add --name <name>` then `openclaw agents list` to verify |
| Search returns corrections from wrong agent | User playbooks aren't scoped | Verify `--user-id` matches the agent name; check with `reflexio user-playbooks list --user-id <name>` |
