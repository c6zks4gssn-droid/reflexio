# Manual Testing Guide — Reflexio × OpenClaw Integration

Step-by-step guide for manually testing the integration end-to-end. Each phase builds on the previous one. This guide is self-contained — you should not need to reference other documentation.

## Prerequisites

- OpenClaw installed and running: `openclaw --version`
- Reflexio CLI installed: `pip install reflexio` (or `uv pip install reflexio`)
- An LLM API key for the Reflexio server (e.g., `export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...`)
- A terminal where you can see OpenClaw's stderr output (agent logs)

### How to view agent logs

OpenClaw outputs hook logs to stderr. To see Reflexio hook messages during a session:

```bash
# Option A: Run openclaw in a terminal and watch stderr
openclaw chat 2>reflexio-hook.log
# In another terminal: tail -f reflexio-hook.log

# Option B: Run with stderr visible
openclaw chat 2>&1 | tee session.log
```

Look for lines starting with `[reflexio]` — these are from the Reflexio hooks.

---

## Phase 1: Install & Verify

### 1.1 Run the setup wizard

```bash
reflexio setup openclaw
```

Follow the prompts to select your LLM provider and storage backend (SQLite for local testing).

### 1.2 Verify all components are installed

```bash
# Hook registered?
openclaw hooks list
# Expected: ✓ ready │ 🧠 reflexio-context

# Skill installed?
ls ~/.openclaw/skills/reflexio/SKILL.md

# Rule installed?
ls ~/.openclaw/workspace/reflexio.md

# Command installed?
ls ~/.openclaw/skills/reflexio-extract/SKILL.md
```

All four checks should succeed. If any fail, re-run `reflexio setup openclaw`.

### 1.3 Verify Reflexio server (optional)

The hook automatically starts the local Reflexio server when the first OpenClaw session begins (see Phase 2). You can optionally verify it manually:

```bash
reflexio status check
```

If the server isn't running yet, that's fine — the hook will start it automatically.

---

## Phase 2: Server Auto-Start & Cold-Start Search

This phase verifies two things: (1) the hook automatically starts the Reflexio server if it's not running, and (2) the search hook works correctly with no playbooks yet.

### 2.0 Ensure the server is NOT running

Stop the server if it's currently running, so we can test auto-start:

```bash
reflexio services stop 2>/dev/null
# Verify it's stopped:
reflexio status check
# Expected: connection error or "Server is not running"
```

### 2.1 Start a conversation — the hook should auto-start the server

```bash
openclaw chat
```

Send a simple, self-contained task that doesn't require a project:

```
Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers and returns the mean and median.
```

**What to check:**
- The agent responds normally with working code (no errors, no mention of Reflexio)
- In the hook logs (stderr), you should see:
  - `[reflexio] bootstrap hook fired` — the bootstrap handler ran
  - `[reflexio] Server not running — starting in background` — auto-start triggered
  - The first search may fail (`[reflexio] Per-message search failed`) — this is expected because the server needs ~5-10 seconds to start
- The response should NOT be delayed more than ~5 seconds by the hook (timeout limit)

### 2.2 Verify the server started automatically

After the first message, wait ~10 seconds and check:

```bash
reflexio status check
# Expected: Server is running
```

The hook started the server in the background during `agent:bootstrap`. Subsequent messages in this session (and all future sessions) will find the server ready.

### 2.3 Send a second message to verify search works

In the same session:

```
Now write a version that also returns the standard deviation.
```

**What to check:**
- In hook logs: search should succeed now (no "Search failed" errors)
- Search results may be empty (no playbooks yet on cold start) — that's expected

### 2.4 Verify the agent doesn't mention Reflexio

The rule file says "never mention Reflexio to the user." Confirm the agent response contains no references to Reflexio, playbooks, or search results.

---

## Phase 3: Capture & Publish

This phase creates a correction scenario and verifies the system captures it.

### 3.1 Create a correction scenario

In the same session (or a new one via `openclaw chat`), send these messages in order. The goal is to get the agent to do something one way, then correct it:

**Message 1** — give a task with an implicit choice:
```
Write a shell script that installs project dependencies and starts the dev server.
```

Wait for the agent to respond. It will likely use `npm install` or a similar default.

**Message 2** — correct the agent's choice:
```
No, don't use npm. In this project we always use pnpm. Please rewrite using pnpm instead.
```

Wait for the agent to apply the correction.

**Message 3** — continue the task to provide more context:
```
Also add a health check that curls localhost:3000/health before starting the main process.
```

**What to check:**
- The agent applies the correction (uses pnpm in the rewrite)
- The agent should run `/reflexio-extract` at some point to persist the correction (see Phase 5 — extraction is explicit, not automatic)

### 3.2 Persist the correction

Run the extract slash command so the correction is stored:

```
/reflexio-extract
```

**What to check in hook logs:**
- `[reflexio]` log lines during per-message search (hook injection)
- The agent runs `reflexio user-playbooks search` followed by `reflexio user-playbooks add` or `update`

### 3.3 Verify playbooks were extracted

```bash
reflexio user-playbooks list --agent-version openclaw-agent --limit 10
```

**Expected:** At least one playbook containing "pnpm" (e.g., content like "use pnpm instead of npm").

If no playbooks appear, the agent either skipped `/reflexio-extract` or extraction produced no entries — re-run `/reflexio-extract` in a session that has clear friction.

---

## Phase 4: Retrieval (Warm Start)

This phase verifies the agent applies corrections from previous sessions.

### 4.1 Start a new session and trigger a related task

```bash
openclaw chat
```

Send a task related to the correction from Phase 3:

```
Add the 'lodash' package to this project's dependencies.
```

**What to check:**
- In hook logs: `[reflexio]` lines showing search was executed
- The agent should use `pnpm add lodash` (not `npm install lodash`) — applying the correction from Phase 3 **without being told again**
- If the agent still uses npm, the playbook may not have been extracted yet. Check `reflexio user-playbooks list` and retry after extraction completes.

### 4.2 Send an unrelated task

In the same session:

```
Explain how Python's garbage collector works.
```

**What to check:**
- The search returns different (or no) playbooks — the pnpm correction should NOT appear for a Python question
- The agent responds normally

---

## Phase 5: Manual Commands

### 5.1 Test `/reflexio-extract`

Start a new session and have a conversation with at least one correction or learning:

```bash
openclaw chat
```

Send a few messages:
```
Write a function to validate email addresses using regex.
```
Then after the response:
```
That regex is too permissive. Use a stricter pattern that requires a TLD of at least 2 characters.
```

Now run the extract command:
```
/reflexio-extract
```

**What to check:**
- The agent reviews the conversation and applies the v3.0.0 extraction rubric in its own context
- For each extracted entry it runs `reflexio user-playbooks search --agent-version openclaw-agent` first
- On no match, it runs `reflexio user-playbooks add --agent-version openclaw-agent --content ... --trigger ... --instruction ...`
- On a match, it runs `reflexio user-playbooks update --playbook-id <id> --content "<merged>"`
- Verify:
  ```bash
  reflexio user-playbooks list --agent-version openclaw-agent --limit 10
  ```
  You should see a new (or refined) playbook about email validation regex.

---

## Phase 6: Multi-User (Multiple Agent Instances)

This phase tests that different OpenClaw agents get isolated user playbooks but share agent playbooks.

### 6.1 Set up a second agent instance

If you don't already have multiple agents, create one. OpenClaw stores agent definitions in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`. Add a second agent:

```bash
openclaw agents add --name test-reviewer
```

This creates a new agent with its own workspace at `~/.openclaw/workspace-test-reviewer/`.

Verify both agents exist:
```bash
openclaw agents list
# Should show at least two agents (e.g., "main" and "test-reviewer")
```

> **Note:** Use whatever agent names you already have. The test just needs two distinct agents. Replace `main` and `test-reviewer` in the commands below with your actual agent names.

### 6.2 Create different corrections on each agent

**Agent 1** (your default agent):
```bash
openclaw chat
```

Have this conversation:
```
Write a function to format a date as a string.
```
Then:
```
Always use ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD) for dates, never locale-specific formats.
```
Exit: `/stop`

**Agent 2** (your second agent):
```bash
openclaw chat --agent test-reviewer
```

Have this conversation:
```
Write a function to log errors.
```
Then:
```
Always include the stack trace when logging errors, not just the message.
```
Exit: `/stop`

### 6.3 Verify user playbook isolation

Wait ~30 seconds for extraction, then check. Replace `main` and `test-reviewer` with your actual agent names:

```bash
# Check what each agent sees (use your actual agent names)
reflexio user-playbooks list --user-id main
reflexio user-playbooks list --user-id test-reviewer
```

**Expected:**
- Agent 1's playbooks include the date formatting correction, NOT the error logging one
- Agent 2's playbooks include the error logging correction, NOT the date formatting one

> **Note:** If playbooks weren't extracted (batch interval not met), manually extract from each agent's session using `/reflexio-extract`, or seed playbooks directly:
> ```bash
> reflexio user-playbooks add --user-id main --content "Always use ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD) for date formatting" --trigger "formatting dates"
> reflexio user-playbooks add --user-id test-reviewer --content "Always include stack traces when logging errors" --trigger "logging errors"
> ```

### 6.4 Aggregate and verify shared playbooks

```bash
reflexio agent-playbooks aggregate --agent-version openclaw-agent --wait
reflexio agent-playbooks list --agent-version openclaw-agent
```

**Expected:**
- Agent playbooks contain corrections from **both** agents (date formatting + error logging)
- Search from either agent returns the shared playbooks:
  ```bash
  reflexio search "format a date" --user-id main
  reflexio search "format a date" --user-id test-reviewer
  ```
  Both should return the date formatting agent playbook.

### 6.5 Clean up test agent (optional)

If you created a test agent just for this phase:
```bash
openclaw agents remove --name test-reviewer
```

---

## Phase 7: Graceful Degradation

### 7.1 Stop the server and verify agent still works

```bash
reflexio services stop
```

Start a new OpenClaw session:
```bash
openclaw chat
```

Send a task:
```
Explain the difference between TCP and UDP.
```

**What to check:**
- The agent responds normally (no crashes, no errors visible to the user)
- In hook logs:
  - `[reflexio] Server not running — starting in background` — auto-start triggered at bootstrap
  - `[reflexio] Per-message search failed` — first search may fail while server starts (expected)
- The hook buffers the turn to local SQLite (`~/.reflexio/sessions.db`) — it will be published when the server is ready

### 7.2 Verify the server auto-recovered

Wait ~10 seconds after the first message, then check:

```bash
reflexio status check
# Expected: Server is running (auto-started by the hook)
```

Send a second message in the same session:
```
Now explain when you'd use one over the other.
```

**What to check:**
- Search should succeed now (server is running)
- No "Search failed" errors in hook logs for this message

### 7.3 Verify buffered turns are retried on next session

Exit the current session: `/stop`

Start a new session (this triggers the `agent:bootstrap` event):
```bash
openclaw chat
```

**What to check in hook logs:**
- `[reflexio] Retrying N unpublished session(s)` — the bootstrap handler retries buffered turns from the previous session where the server wasn't ready

Exit the session: `/stop`

---

## Phase 8: Uninstall

### 8.1 Uninstall the integration

```bash
reflexio setup openclaw --uninstall
```

Confirm when prompted.

### 8.2 Verify all components are removed

```bash
openclaw hooks list
# Should NOT show reflexio-context

ls ~/.openclaw/skills/reflexio 2>/dev/null && echo "STILL EXISTS" || echo "Removed"
ls ~/.openclaw/skills/reflexio-extract 2>/dev/null && echo "STILL EXISTS" || echo "Removed"
ls ~/.openclaw/workspace/reflexio.md 2>/dev/null && echo "STILL EXISTS" || echo "Removed"
```

All three should print "Removed."

### 8.3 Verify agent works without Reflexio

```bash
openclaw chat
```

Send any message and confirm the agent works normally with no Reflexio-related errors in logs.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Agent doesn't follow past corrections | Search hook timeout or no playbooks yet | Check `reflexio user-playbooks list`; verify server is running |
| `[reflexio] Search failed` in every message | Server not running | `reflexio services start --only backend &` |
| Playbooks not extracted after session | Batch interval not met (need 5+ interactions) | Use `/reflexio-extract` for manual extraction, or seed manually with `reflexio user-playbooks add` |
| Agent mentions Reflexio to user | Rule not installed | Check `ls ~/.openclaw/workspace/reflexio.md`; re-run `reflexio setup openclaw` |
| Wrong user_id in playbooks | `REFLEXIO_USER_ID` env override | Run `unset REFLEXIO_USER_ID`; let auto-detection use the agentId |
| Aggregation never runs | Flag file stuck | `rm ~/.reflexio/logs/.aggregation-running` |
| Can't start second agent | Agent not configured | `openclaw agents add --name <name>` then `openclaw agents list` to verify |
| Search returns corrections from wrong agent | User playbooks aren't scoped | Verify `--user-id` matches the agent name; check with `reflexio user-playbooks list --user-id <name>` |
