# Playbook Service
Description: Playbook extraction, aggregation, and deduplication pipeline

> Part of the [Reflexio Server](../../README.md). See also the [Prompt Bank](../../prompt/prompt_bank/README.md) for prompt template details.

## Main Entry Points

- **Service Orchestrator**: `playbook_generation_service.py` - Manages playbook extraction lifecycle (regular, rerun, manual modes)
- **Playbook Extractor**: `playbook_extractor.py` - Extracts user playbooks from interactions via LLM
- **Playbook Aggregator**: `playbook_aggregator.py` - Clusters similar user playbooks and generates aggregated insights
- **Playbook Deduplicator**: `playbook_deduplicator.py` - Merges duplicate playbooks from multiple extractors using LLM

## Supporting Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `playbook_service_constants.py` | Prompt IDs for all playbook operations |
| `playbook_service_utils.py` | Request dataclasses, Pydantic output schemas, message construction utilities |

## Architecture

### Data Flow

```
Interactions
  -> PlaybookExtractor (per-extractor, extraction-only, parallel)
    -> PlaybookDeduplicator (deduplicates new vs existing DB playbooks)
      -> UserPlaybook (with optional blocking_issue) -> Storage
        -> PlaybookAggregator (manual trigger)
          -> AgentPlaybook (aggregated insights) -> Storage
```

### Playbook Extraction (`playbook_extractor.py`)

Extends `BaseGenerationService` extractor pattern. Each extractor:
1. Checks batch_interval threshold before running
2. Constructs messages from interactions (via `service_utils.py`)
3. Runs LLM with `playbook_extraction_main` prompt
4. Parses `StructuredPlaybookContent` output (trigger, instruction, pitfall, blocking_issue)
5. Saves `UserPlaybook` to storage

**Tool Analysis**: Reads `tool_can_use` from root `Config` for tool usage analysis and blocking issue detection.

### Playbook Aggregation (`playbook_aggregator.py`)

Triggered manually via `/api/run_playbook_aggregation`. Clusters user playbooks and generates consolidated insights.

**Key Methods**:
- `get_clusters(user_playbooks, config)` - HDBSCAN/Agglomerative clustering on embeddings
- `aggregate()` - Full aggregation pipeline with LLM-based consolidation
- `_build_change_log()` - Builds `PlaybookAggregationChangeLog` with before/after snapshots (added/removed/updated playbooks)

**Change Log**: After each aggregation, saves a `PlaybookAggregationChangeLog` to storage. In full_archive mode, all old playbooks are "removed" and new ones "added". In incremental mode, maps old->new via fingerprints to detect updates. Saving is best-effort (failures logged, don't block aggregation).

**Clustering**: Embeds user playbooks -> HDBSCAN clustering -> falls back to Agglomerative if too few clusters

### Playbook Deduplication (`playbook_deduplicator.py`)

Deduplicates newly extracted playbooks against existing playbooks in the database via LLM semantic matching. Identifies duplicates between new extractions and existing DB playbooks, merging where appropriate.

## Prompt IDs

| Constant | Prompt ID | Used By |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| `PLAYBOOK_EXTRACTION_SHOULD_GENERATE_PROMPT_ID` | `playbook_should_generate` | PlaybookExtractor |
| `PLAYBOOK_EXTRACTION_CONTEXT_PROMPT_ID` | `playbook_extraction_context` | PlaybookExtractor |
| `PLAYBOOK_EXTRACTION_PROMPT_ID` | `playbook_extraction_main` | PlaybookExtractor |
| `PLAYBOOK_GENERATION_PROMPT_ID` | `playbook_generation` | PlaybookAggregator |

## Key Output Schemas (in `playbook_service_utils.py`)

| Class | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `StructuredPlaybookContent` | Output from playbook extraction prompt |
| `PlaybookGenerationRequest` | Request dataclass for playbook extraction |
| `PlaybookAggregatorRequest` | Request dataclass for playbook aggregation |
